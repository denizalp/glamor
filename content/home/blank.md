With the rise of the internet and electronic commerce, researchers have been facing problems arising from the behavior of selfish agents in multi-agent systems. The invention of Game Theory coupled with the recent progress in Artificial Inteligence (AI) and Computer Science Theory have led to the emergence of a multitude of tools that can allow researchers to solve such problems. Particularly, as AI progresses, companies and institutions make use of intelligent agents to manipulate the outcomes of systems with multiple intelligent pariticipants.

The GLAMOR (Games, Learning, Algorithms, Models, Optimization and Research) Laboratory is a research group in Brown University's Computer Science department. Our group's research focuses on game theory, optimization, multi-agent systems and more broadly economic computation and is led by Amy Greenwald. Our research goals are two-fold: (1) to design and implement AI agents that interact effectively in multiagent  environments, and (2) to  understand and accurately predict the dynamics of such interactions.
