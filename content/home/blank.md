# Our Lab

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the automation of complex processes involving multiple participants that were traditionally arbitrated by humans. As our institutions continue to automate more and more such processes, the need to be able to predict and explain the outcomes of multiagent systems is becoming paramount. Related, the AI that inhabit such systems must be able to interact effectively with other intelligent agents.

The **GLAMOR** (Games, Learning, Agents, Modeling, Operations Research) group is a research group at Brown University's Computer Science department that aims to solve exactly such problems. Our group's research focuses on game theory, optimization, multiagent systems—more broadly economics and computation—and is led by Amy Greenwald. Our research goals are two-fold: (1) to design and implement AI agents that interact effectively in multiagent environments, and (2) to understand and accurately predict the dynamics of such interactions.
